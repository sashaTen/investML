###    REMEMBER THE GOLDEN  RULES OF INFO : 
1 always learn since the bigger picture you have the  more you  know gaps and your case 
2 what is key value of knowledge/tool/concept  , how the proccess must  look like and decide if it fits your case  and your  constraints allow you 

******* CI-CD   :
Ultra-short memory hook 🧩

ML system → structure & behavior 

MLOps → automation & reliability
-- releases.automation.monitoring .testing.

--road :   linux (os  and  network)-> scripts(python/YAML/BASH)-> cloud-> docker/kuber ->infra

*******.so goals   are   : 
-----------PRIORITY :
-- get the big picture in order to reason about the concepts  and tools roles to  create  references
and  apply  from  the   devOps  what  is  needed  for   your   case (it's contraints).  it  is   also  helps 
to  practice  docker things   like .   and to  reason  about   workflow.    also the   ultimate goals  are :
1.understanding the big picture of devops and how to  choose tools  +  strategies  for  imrpovement and trpubleshooting 
2. one clean ci/cd pipeline for your case and reason why  as well as  potential   improvements 


-- create rules  for   writing good   code  and learn database   management and  design  for that  you  need   the   knowledge from  SE for DS :
1  task  is to  add new cool   tech ,    new  feature  or  improve the app in general by applying  SE  like handling  potential  breakdowns.     
....START   APPLYING   FROM  HERE.DONE 
--------END OF   PRIORITY

--SaaS.   find  very  doable   one  and then  try   to   learn  only    topics  relevant to  it. like 
database   management and  design   ,  backend   ,  django   a  bit   deeper.  but  dont  learn   just for the  sake  of  leanrinig . learn  in  order to   replicate  and  adapt  their  success.     
1.  the task  is  to   build the MVP   before  the  semester.
