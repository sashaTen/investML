###    REMEMBER THE GOLDEN  RULES OF INFO : 
1 always learn since the bigger picture you have the  more you  know gaps and your case 
2 what is key value of knowledge/tool/concept  , how the proccess must  look like and decide if it fits your case  and your  constraints allow you 

******* CI-CD   :
Ultra-short memory hook 🧩

ML system → structure & behavior 

MLOps → automation & reliability
-- releases.automation.monitoring .testing.

--road :   linux (os  and  network)-> scripts(python/YAML/BASH)-> cloud-> docker/kuber ->infra

*******.so goals   are   : 
-----------PRIORITY :
-- get the big picture in order to reason about the concepts  and tools roles to  create  references
and  apply  from  the   devOps  what  is  needed  for   your   case (it's contraints).  it  is   also  helps 
to  practice  docker things   like .   and to  reason  about   workflow.    also the   ultimate goals  are :
1.understanding the big picture of devops and how to  choose tools  +  strategies  for  imrpovement and trpubleshooting 
2. one clean ci/cd pipeline for your case and reason why  as well as  potential   improvements 


-- create rules  for   writing good   code  and learn database   management and  design  for that  you  need   the   knowledge from  SE for DS :
1  task  is to  add new cool   tech ,    new  feature  or  improve the app in general by applying  SE  like handling  potential  breakdowns.     
....START   APPLYING   FROM  HERE.DONE 
--------END OF   PRIORITY

--SaaS.   find  very  doable   one  and then  try   to   learn  only    topics  relevant to  it. like 
database   management and  design   ,  backend   ,  django   a  bit   deeper.  but  dont  learn   just for the  sake  of  leanrinig . learn  in  order to   replicate  and  adapt  their  success.     
1.  the task  is  to   build the MVP   before  the  semester.    



******************CHAPTER 1 dev ops    intro 
..build, test, and deploy code continuously, enabling deployment in hours instead of days.
..makes code moves from development to production quickly, reliably, and securely.(build-> test->deploy->monitor).
..unit  ,   integration  ,perfomance , secirity tests 
..goes to  stagying   and  if    good then different  strategies for the deployment 
Blue-Green Deployment,Canary Deployment , Rolling Updates  
..Continuous Feedback Loop :   monitoring ,  feedback  and all done with   grafana  and   like   tools 
..How to Adopt a DevOps Model?
..mlops   :   
DevOps tools generate a huge amount of data from testing, deployment, and monitoring for AI and ML.

..surprise   : 
not  only  the    ml  needs the  devops but the ml   can aid the devops  and  imrpove their 
perfomance  for example   ml  can   find the bugs  and more.  tasks  like classification  and 
predictions  are  very  important  for the devops .     
.. for example  you   have the server  which   runs 24/7 but  you can  write  script  which  turns  it  off   
during   night   for  example .    
..Prerequisites Before Learning DevOps
Operating Systems & Networking, 2. Version Control with Git (VCS),3. Programming & Scripting Skills
4. Linux Fundamentals, 5. Cloud Computing Basics
..Virtual Machines (VMs)
A computer you rent in the cloud
Acts like a real Linux/Windows machine
..you also    can  build cloud   native apps   
..7  practices  of  devops 
Continuous Development (one small change of code is tested and deployed like login or design)
Continuous Integration  (to  integrate it above you automate steps with  CI/CD)
Continuous Testing      (does code  do  what  expected)
Continuous Deployment/Continuous Delivery  (sometimes it is ok  to keep final deploy manual like with  click) 
Continuous Monitoring(to keep  improving the app you need  measures and monitoring   helps like alert of long load)
Continuous Feedback(complain from review that update is not fast and The DevOps improve the tracking speed.)
Continuous Operations (not shut down app while improve feature but keep it run)

******************  CHAPTER 1  dev ops    intro tasks:
.. no   hard coding .  only   plan  / design/ strategy and gaps for below.
How to Adopt a DevOps Model?
To adopt a DevOps model, ensure the following points:

Assess Current Workflow: Evaluate your existing development and operations processes to identify gaps, inefficiencies, and areas for automation.
Set Clear DevOps Goals: Define measurable objectives such as faster deployment cycles, better collaboration, or improved system stability.
Build a Collaborative Culture: Break silos between development, operations, QA, and security teams by encouraging communication and shared responsibilities.
Automate Infrastructure and Testing: Use tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible to automate code integration, deployment, testing, and infrastructure provisioning.
Implement CI/CD Pipelines: Establish Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for faster, error-free code delivery.
Monitor and Optimize Continuously: Use real-time monitoring and feedback loops (via tools like Prometheus, Grafana) to track performance and improve systems iteratively.
..https://www.terminaltemple.com/   practice  linux  here.  
..the   re-build   of the  docker  image   is ineffective   but   by caching you can optimize  it   so  apply  it  later.   
The hardware includes CPU, ALU, memory, I/O devices, peripheral devices and storage devices.
The system programs include compilers, loaders, editors and the OS itself.
CPU controls and processes all computer operations
ALU performs arithmetic and logical calculations
RAM temporarily stores data and programs in use
ROM stores permanent instructions for booting
..goals   of   os :
make programs run well, resource of computer manage ,  security 
..shell and kernel  
..kernel   is   the  translator   between   hard  and  users 
..when computer is on the cpu which  is  brain is  working in the instruction -fetch -execute -memory cycle
the cpu  has the units like  control , alu , cache ,  mmu ,register, momory controller.




**************CHAPTER 2. Linux for DevOps 
OS perating System(OS) is a software that manages and handles hardware and software resources of a computing device.
interface between computer hardware and the user.All other programs, including application programs, run on top.
It assigns resources such as memory, processors, and input/output devices to processes that need them. 











************FINAL  TASKS  :
.. review  all   topics  and  form the  vision of   your   devops.    like for in intro you learned about the  continious  operation   and   etc   but  it is hard to  do  before  you  learned  the  topic  so  review  all   learned  and    implement   .   do  all  tasks  from   chapter   1   since   it  is   broad  and  tells  how it should  be.
