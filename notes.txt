RE-READ   EVERY  DAY  AND   REMEMBER  THERE  RULES 
FOR   EVERY  SECCION   LIKE    ACTIVATION  AND DEACTIVATION OF THE   .VENV  AS WELL 
AS  FINISHING  THE  requirements    AND  CHECKING THE   PERFOMANCE  AND 
ANALYSING  AND    FIXING  CODE   ACCORDING   THE   REPRODUCIBILITY AND PERFOMANCE

..2 database   design 
..3 database for ml predictions time and tickers 
..4 dynamic   oages   for   example  for  example   you  dont  create    for each product item separate  detail page  or links 
with   info   transfer



cd project
source .venv/bin/activate   # or Windows activate
# work
pip freeze > requirements.txt   # only if deps changed
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push




git status


*** day 1    :    ***
python -m venv .venv

.venv\Scripts\activate

your project files should be in the same parent folder as .venv.

pip install django
pip freeze > requirements.txt

django-admin startproject config .


create    view /  url  and   main  url


git init
git path to  github repo
git rm -r --cached .venv / if  you  pushed the env to the github
git add / commit / push 


daily    practice :
cd project
 # or Windows activate
# work
pip freeze > requirements.txt   # only if deps changed
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push

today    i deleted   env  due to    gitignore issue  
because  of  powershell  encoding  and etc    the  system   did   not see the gitignore
however  you should   to  check  root  -cause   .   the biggest  issue  was  that   git  did not see 
so the fix   is   to  make it   vsisible 


You are on Windows
Windows tools love UTF-16.
Git only understands .gitignore if it is plain text (ASCII or UTF-8 without BOM).
If the encoding is wrong → Git silently ignores the file.
2️ You create .gitignore using:
Notepad
PowerShell echo
PowerShell Set-Content (default)
➡️ File becomes UTF-16
➡️ Git cannot parse it
3️⃣ Symptoms you saw
These are signature symptoms:
.venv keeps appearing in git status
git check-ignore -v .venv prints nothing
.gitignore looks correct when you open it
Push becomes very slow (because .venv is huge)
Once you see this pattern → think encoding immediately.

git check-ignore -v .venv
Get-Content .gitignore -Encoding Byte
If you see zeros → you found the bug.
Set-Content -Encoding Ascii .gitignore ".venv`n**/.venv/"





*** day 2  : *****
downloaded   the  stock data 
created    ml_model.python


below   global  things   have to  be   level  up    as 
the global    variables  not in the  functions because  they 
are initialized   every   time the   function called  so   it  is 
bad for the perfomance 

"""lemma = WordNetLemmatizer()
stopwordSet = set(stopwords.words("english"))"""

i  also put    prepreccess and  the train  aside 
so   i  can    call the  preprocess  while the train   
is not called   saved    since   it  is re-trained 
every  time  run  server  



"""cv = joblib.load("count_vectorizer.pkl")
pca = joblib.load("pca.pkl")
model = joblib.load("logreg_model.pkl")"""
those  are  also need to  be  in global so  every http req 
does not  call  it   



when   inference   you   
apply  "transform"  
and  not    "fit"   since   you  dont  train
and only  need the  transform
"""cv.transform(data)
pca.transform(data)"""


'''ALWAYS  IN THE END  OF THE CODE  WRITING 
IF   IT'S  functionS  ASK AND CORRECT  FROM  PERCEPTIVE 
OF PERFOMANCE'''




*****day 3   ********:
now prediction   is   in the prediction   page 
and the index   page  is   just the  home page 
never    forget  to   activate the .venv 



create   class  in models  like  tickers  for ex 
then make migrations 
migrate 
admin register   





*********day   4* **********

added the    template   for the   main   page  
main   page   greets  the   users    and  explains   the  
functionalities   of the app 


******   day 5    management   of   users *********


A session is how Django remembers who you are between page requests.


user   creation  is  very  simple  in    django .   
{{  }}-   is for   variables   display  

{%  %}    for  "if"    or   "for"   is is  the logic in templates

{{user}}   -    by   this you  load the logged in   user 

you create   sign up   by  creatin  the template for  form  
and view  which  if  GET displays the form 
and if from  this page  you  get POST the   django saves this form to the users model 
""""  if request.method == "POST":
        form = UserCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            user = form.save()
            login(request, user)
            return redirect(reverse("dashboard"))  """"



Work With Django Auth
it is automated authentication system and an authorization system
in global url path("accounts/", include("django.contrib.auth.urls"))
names  of the  urls  are  "login" and "logout"

The "login" URL finds the LoginView.
The LoginView looks for a template in registration/ named login.html.  

so  basically you just create the auth url -> template and that's it 
since  the  model , seccion and  LoginView is done by django 
in the settingns  write LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "dashboard"


******  day 6  *******

1    i created    base   portfolio   
in there 
 user = models.ForeignKey(
        settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name="portfolios"
    )
above is  foreignkey  for  one  portfolio one user who is  logged in 

then PortfolioCreateForm was created  .   with  fields 
this form from django that   you pass   through  view to  the  template
if GET the page  shows  form
if POST the page saves  the  portfolio and redirect  to  the   portfolio_list page.
so   to run   it  well the   template portfolio gets the form and sends to  views
the redirect  is calling  the link with name "portfolio_list" which  causes  the  view function
called portfolio_list  and  it if logged in  aka login_required 
finds the portfolios of the current seccion  user   and   gives   it to    template
this is the  key  line 
"""def portfolio_list(request):
    portfolios = Portfolio.objects.filter(user=request.user) """

if not   looged   in   while creatin   portfolio  it 
leads   you to the login   page   and then only after login  you  
can access the portfolio create page  .  in portfolio list you  see  all portfolios of current  user 


*****   day  7 ******
Creating or updating a model → ModelForm
Just selecting / filtering / calculating → Form



 user = models.ForeignKey(
        settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name="tickers",default=None
    )
i made above  so   when  logged in users choose the stock
the information  about  who is user  is   also  saved 
and when   i need  to display user's  stocks  i can  
simply filter   them 


user = models.OneToOneField   is self  explainable 

form.Form   is   read  only  vs    modelForm  is  for operations 


next   plan   is   
tickers =  models.ManyToManyField(Tickers, related_name='portfolios')
add  the  tickers  to   portfolio

@login_required
def choose_tickers(request):
    if request.method == "POST":    
        form = TickerForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            ticker_obj = form.save(commit=False)    # wait  for user auth
            ticker_obj.user = request.user          # ticker.user field =  user auth passed to  form 
            ticker_obj = form.save()  # saves to DB   
            return HttpResponse(
                f"Ticker: {ticker_obj.ticker}, Prediction: {ticker_obj.prediction}"
            )
    else:
        form = TickerForm()  # 👈 VERY IMPORTANT

    return render(request, "choose_tickers.html", {"form": form})  



def dashboard(request):
    if request.user.is_anonymous:
         context = {"tickers": []}
    else:
        tickers = Tickers.objects.filter(user=request.user)
        context = {"tickers": tickers}
    return render(request, "users.html", context)
    it is  very  important to if is_anonymous 
    so no   ticjers   displayed   and  if    auth  then 
    filter   and  shows   yours 
    


    ********day  7 ********* 
    i want the  user  to  able to   choose  the stocks   he chose 
    not  from  all   users.    


    toay  i  only   updates   forms    and  got  rid  of fielf  for  tickers 
       



******* day  8 ************
try :
            portfolio = Portfolio.objects.get(user=request.user)
            portfolio.tickers.add(*tickers)
        except Portfolio.DoesNotExist:
            return redirect("create_portfolio")
above   works   now    and  adds   tickers  to   individual  portfolio of user 




*******day 9 ******
logout fixed  design


i add  the function  to   delete the   ticker 
A button in HTML
When clicked → it sends a POST request
Django receives the request
Django finds the ticker
Django deletes it
Django redirects back to dashboard
via form  i send the  post  with  action="{% url 'delete_ticker' ticker.id %}" btn  
it calls the  function with  name   delete_ticker
then  url   calls  the  function delete_ticker
path("delete_ticker/<int:ticker_id>/", delete_ticker, name="delete_ticker"),
the fucntion   has   input  such  as def delete_ticker(request, ticker_id):
so the  url   besides the request (GET/POST) gives the  ticker_id as input 
then ticker = Tickers.objects.get(id=ticker_id, user=request.user)
and ticker.delete   gets rid of it
