RE-READ   EVERY  DAY  AND   REMEMBER  THERE  RULES 
FOR   EVERY  SECCION   LIKE    ACTIVATION  AND DEACTIVATION OF THE   .VENV  AS WELL 
AS  FINISHING  THE  requirements    AND  CHECKING THE   PERFOMANCE  AND 
ANALYSING  AND    FIXING  CODE   ACCORDING   THE   REPRODUCIBILITY AND PERFOMANCE 



cd project
source .venv/bin/activate   # or Windows activate
# work
pip freeze > requirements.txt   # only if deps changed
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push




git status


*** day 1    :    ***
python -m venv .venv

.venv\Scripts\activate

your project files should be in the same parent folder as .venv.

pip install django
pip freeze > requirements.txt

django-admin startproject config .


create    view /  url  and   main  url


git init
git path to  github repo
git rm -r --cached .venv / if  you  pushed the env to the github
git add / commit / push 


daily    practice :
cd project
 # or Windows activate
# work
pip freeze > requirements.txt   # only if deps changed
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push

today    i deleted   env  due to    gitignore issue  
because  of  powershell  encoding  and etc    the  system   did   not see the gitignore
however  you should   to  check  root  -cause   .   the biggest  issue  was  that   git  did not see 
so the fix   is   to  make it   vsisible 


You are on Windows
Windows tools love UTF-16.
Git only understands .gitignore if it is plain text (ASCII or UTF-8 without BOM).
If the encoding is wrong → Git silently ignores the file.
2️ You create .gitignore using:
Notepad
PowerShell echo
PowerShell Set-Content (default)
➡️ File becomes UTF-16
➡️ Git cannot parse it
3️⃣ Symptoms you saw
These are signature symptoms:
.venv keeps appearing in git status
git check-ignore -v .venv prints nothing
.gitignore looks correct when you open it
Push becomes very slow (because .venv is huge)
Once you see this pattern → think encoding immediately.

git check-ignore -v .venv
Get-Content .gitignore -Encoding Byte
If you see zeros → you found the bug.
Set-Content -Encoding Ascii .gitignore ".venv`n**/.venv/"





*** day 2  : *****
downloaded   the  stock data 
created    ml_model.python


below   global  things   have to  be   level  up    as 
the global    variables  not in the  functions because  they 
are initialized   every   time the   function called  so   it  is 
bad for the perfomance 

"""lemma = WordNetLemmatizer()
stopwordSet = set(stopwords.words("english"))"""

i  also put    prepreccess and  the train  aside 
so   i  can    call the  preprocess  while the train   
is not called   saved    since   it  is re-trained 
every  time  run  server  



"""cv = joblib.load("count_vectorizer.pkl")
pca = joblib.load("pca.pkl")
model = joblib.load("logreg_model.pkl")"""
those  are  also need to  be  in global so  every http req 
does not  call  it   



when   inference   you   
apply  "transform"  
and  not    "fit"   since   you  dont  train
and only  need the  transform
"""cv.transform(data)
pca.transform(data)"""


'''ALWAYS  IN THE END  OF THE CODE  WRITING 
IF   IT'S  functionS  ASK AND CORRECT  FROM  PERCEPTIVE 
OF PERFOMANCE'''




*****day 3   ********:
now prediction   is   in the prediction   page 
and the index   page  is   just the  home page 
never    forget  to   activate the .venv 



create   class  in models  like  tickers  for ex 
then make migrations 
migrate 
admin register   





*********day   4* **********

added the    template   for the   main   page  
main   page   greets  the   users    and  explains   the  
functionalities   of the app
